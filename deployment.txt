So far: 
 - local file is displaying correctly
 - code is deploying successfully
 - blank screen is showing. example vite deployment is being used.
 Error:
martinrombach88.github.io/:1 Failed to load module script: 
Expected a JavaScript module script but the server responded with a MIME type of "text/html". 
Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec. 
martinrombach88.github.io/:1 Uncaught (in promise) Error: 
A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received

The problem isn't related to the vite project deployment (there are plenty of others with success)
It's likely related to your module files.

The error is in one of the imported CSS files you used (bootstrap etc).
